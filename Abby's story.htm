<h3> <center><b>CHAPTER I</b></center> </h3>

<center><p> We were moving. Again. 'Why?' I thought sadly. 'Why move now? 
I like it here.'<br> I looked around at my room, a room I've had for 3 years. Now we're moving
again. I looked at my cell phone anxiously, waiting for my best friend,<br> Selena Hanson, to call or text or at least something. 
We first met at a book club, where we were partnered for a book review project.<br> We soon discovered that they had many things in common,
such as we both like Warrior cats books, medieval fantasy with dragons and knights and princesses that<br> need saving, and books about mythology like Percy Jackson.</p>

<p>"Abby Angela Harris, get down here right now!" I heard from downstairs. When I got to the living room, Mom was<br>tapping her toe on the floor,
a sign that she was impatient. "Will you <i>please</i> help me and your father move these boxes instead of just standing there sulking?"<br> She said angrily.  
"Okay," I said, "and I'm not sulking." My dad jogged up the front walkway. "Will you move this box to the van please?" <br> "Fine!" I snatch up the
box and stomp to the car, calling back: "Why do we even have to move?  I want to stay! All of my friends are <i>here</i>! Where are we even <br>moving to anyway!"
To her surprise, My parents didn't look angry, even though usually when I talk back to them I get a talking-to. Dad tried to explain.<br>
"With Junior coming soon, we have to have more space for him or her, <i>and</i> we need a bigger house in general. Remember how we had to make our own shelves for all<br>
our books?" "Yes," I say dejectedly, "I guess I understand." I finish loading the box in the van and come back to the porch, where my parents had moved
to.<br>
