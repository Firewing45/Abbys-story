<h3> <center><b>CHAPTER I</b></center> </h3>
	
<center><p> We were moving. Again. 'Why?' I thought sadly. 'Why move now? 
I like it here.'<br> I looked around at my room, a room I've had for 3 years. Now we're moving
again. I looked at my cell phone anxiously, waiting for my best friend,<br> Selena Hanson, to call or text or at least something. 
We first met at a book club, where we were partnered for a book review project.<br> We soon discovered that they had many things in common,
such as we both like Warrior cats books, medieval fantasy with dragons and knights and princesses that<br> need saving, and books about mythology like Percy Jackson.</p>

<p>"Abby Angela Harris, get down here right now!" I heard from downstairs. When I got to the living room, Mom was<br>tapping her toe on the floor,
a sign that she was impatient. "Will you <i>please</i> help me and your father move these boxes instead of just standing there sulking?"<br> She said angrily.  
"Okay," I said, "and I'm not sulking." My dad jogged up the front walkway. "Will you move this box to the van please?" <br> "Fine!" I snatch up the
box and stomp to the car, calling back: "Why do we even have to move?  I want to stay! All of my friends are <i>here!</i> Where are we even <br>moving to anyway!"
My parents didn't look angry, even though usually when I talk back to them I get a talking-to. Dad tried to explain.<br>
"With Junior coming soon, we have to have more space for him or her, <i>and</i> we need a bigger house in general. Remember how we had to make our own shelves for all<br>
our books?" "Yes," I say dejectedly, "I guess I understand." I finish loading the box in our Honda and come back to the porch, where my parents had moved
to.<br> "But why now?" "That is the question, isn't it?" Dad said with a smile. I glared at him. I forgot to mention that my dad loves Shakespeare(especially Hamlet), and he quotes it <i>all the time!</i> 
<br>It gets really annoying sometimes. Then, my phone rang and I answered it. "Excuse me. Hello? Who is- Hi Selena!....Yeah, I'll call....Are you going to 'see us off'
as dad says?.....<br>Oh.....Well, goodbye and-.....What?.....Yes,I will....'Bye." I must have looked sad, because dad asked, "What's wrong?" "Dad, Selena won't be able to come because she's sick."   
"I'm sorry. I know you were hoping she could come, but now we have to pack up the car." "Okay." I pick up another box, thinking: 'Why is life so hard when you're a teenager? Nothing seems to go the way you want them
 to.'<br> I heard mom say, "don't forget your phone charger, dear!" I went back to my room and picked up my black rabbit, Didi. I sat on my bed and stroked her silky fur before putting her in her cage. 
<br> I picked up her cage and went back to the living room. When I got downstairs, someone was waiting for me.</center></p><br><br><br>

<center><p>It was Alex. He's from my school, and I've liked him for a while. He's cute, and he has a nice smile. "Hi." "Um, hi."(I'm pretty sure I blushed)After an akward silence, mom came to the rescue. "Won't you come in....?"
"Alex." "Alex then. Won't you come in?" He walked in and looked around. "Please excuse the mess, we are moving today." "Oh. Well, I actually came to see if Abby could come over for dinner tonight." I looked at him and I <i>think</i>
his face was just a bit flushed. Does he like me?!
