<h3> <center><b>CHAPTER I</b></center> </h3>
	
<center><p> We were moving. Again. 'Why?' I thought sadly. 'Why move now? 
I like it here.'<br> I looked around at my room, a room I've had for 3 years. Now we're moving
again. I looked at my cell phone anxiously, waiting for my best friend,<br> Selena Hanson, to call or text or at least something. 
We first met at a book club, where we were partnered for a book review project.<br> We soon discovered that they had many things in common,
such as we both like Warrior cats books, medieval fantasy with dragons and knights and princesses that<br> need saving, and books about mythology like Percy Jackson.</p>
<br>***<br>
<p>"Abby Angela Harris, get down here right now!" I heard from downstairs. When I got to the living room, Mom was<br>tapping her toe on the floor,
a sign that she was impatient. "Will you <i>please</i> help me and your father move these boxes instead of just standing there sulking?"<br> She said angrily.  
"Okay," I said, "and I'm not sulking." My dad jogged up the front walkway. "Will you move this box to the van please?" <br> "Fine!" I snatch up the
box and stomp to the car, calling back: "Why do we even have to move?  I want to stay! All of my friends are <i>here!</i> Where are we even <br>moving to anyway!"
My parents didn't look angry, even though usually when I talk back to them I get a talking-to. Dad tried to explain.<br>
"With Junior coming soon, we have to have more space for him or her, <i>and</i> we need a bigger house in general. Remember how we had to make our own shelves for all<br>
our books?" "Yes," I say dejectedly, "I guess I understand." I finish loading the box in our Honda and come back to the porch, where my parents had moved
to.<br> "But why now?" "That is the question, isn't it?" Dad said with a smile. I glared at him. I forgot to mention that my dad loves Shakespeare(especially Hamlet), and he quotes it <i>all the time!</i> 
<br>It gets really annoying sometimes. Then, my phone rang and I answered it. "Excuse me. Hello? Who is- Hi Selena!....Yeah, I'll call....Are you going to 'see us off'
as dad says?.....<br>Oh.....Well, goodbye and-.....What?.....Yes,I will....'Bye." I must have looked sad, because dad asked, "What's wrong?" "Dad, Selena won't be able to come because she's sick."   
"I'm sorry. I know you were hoping she could come, but now we have to pack up the car." "Okay." I pick up another box, thinking: 'Why is life so hard when you're a teenager? Nothing seems to go the way you want them
 to.'<br> I heard mom say, "don't forget your phone charger, dear!" I went back to my room and picked up my black rabbit, Didi. I sat on my bed and stroked her silky fur before putting her in her cage. 
<br> I picked up her cage and went back to the living room. When I got downstairs, someone was waiting for me.</center></p><br><br><br> 
	
<h3><center><b>CHAPTER II</b><center></h3>
		  
<center><p>It's Alex. He's from my school, and I've liked him for a while. He's cute, and he has a nice smile. "Hi." "Um, hi."(I'm pretty sure I blushed)After an akward silence, mom comes to the rescue. "Won't you come in....?"
"Alex." "Alex then. Won't you come in?" He walks in and looks around. "Please excuse the mess, we are moving today." "Oh..Well, I actually came to see if Abby could come over for dinner tonight." He looks at me and
his face is just a bit flushed. Does he like me?! Dad walks in and said, "Hello everyone! Who is this?" I jump in. "Dad, this is Alex. He goes to my school. Alex, this is my dad." "A pleasure to meet you Alex." 
"A pleasure to meet you sir." Mom walked in from the kitchen holding a tray of cookies. "I've been trying to figure out how to get rid of these. Here Alex, take some." He took two, but his phone rang so he put them down. "Excuse me. Hello?....Mom? Is that you?......
Yes.....Okay....I'll get there as soon as I can...Bye." Alex has started to walk out the door. I ask the question we're all thinking. "Where are you going?" "I have to go home. My twin sister is sick and mom needs someone to look after our kittens while she takes her to
the hospital." "Why there?" "She has athsma, and if she has a severe attack, she could die." He jogged down the block and turned. "Hey Abby, you wanna come with me? Bet you'd like our cats." I look at mom, and she nods. "I'll come."(I'm really 
blushing by now)I have to run to catch up with him, and by the time I do I can see his house, though I don't know it. He turns off the road and walks up the steps, taking keys out of his pocket. Unlocking the door takes Alex a few minutes because his fingers are shaking, and
when he opens it, two cats run up to him and rub their heads against his legs, tripping him. " What's your sister's name?" "Selena."</p>
	
	<b><h3><center>CHAPTER III</center></h3></b>
	
<p>I'm shocked! Selena is my best friend, but she never told me she had a twin, especially Alex! I guess she thought I would get all mushy if I knew.....Then a cat scratched me. "Ouch!" I moved away. "That one's Frodo," Alex told me. "He gets impatient." "Well!" I laughed.
"This one is Sam," He laughed, too, and leaned closer, whispering, "I have a secret. Promise you won't tell?" "Okay." "I think they're magic." I am very surprised at this. "Who, the cats?" "Yep. Remember, you promised." "Yeah, but can they...like take us somewhere? in no time at all? like in Narnia?"
"Maybe. I've never tried it, but," he lowers his voice to a whisper again, "once I heard Sam say, 'What will we do Mr. Frodo?' just like in the books." I stared at the cats in disbelief. "A cat. Talked. I don't beleive it....Umm..Frodo? Can you talk?" "Mreow" meowed Frodo. "Of course I can talk, silly!"
Both me and Alex gape at him. "All decent cats do, you know. Isn't that right, Sam?" "Yes, Mr. Frodo." (To us)"Close your mouths! Just because you've never seen a cat talk isn't an excuse to gape at them." He sounded offended, as much as a cat could be offended, I guess. I closed my mouth quickly, and nudged Alex
to do the same. "Sorry. It's just.......I've never seen a talking cat before." "Well, I've never seen a cat-or any animal, actually-who cannot talk. In fact, I've had some pretty interesting talks with Didi, that black rabbit down the way." "Really?" I was about to gape again, but Frodo glared at me.
"You heard what I said. Can you take us to another place or time or dimension?" "Well, sort of," Sam said before Frodo could answer. Frodo just muttered, "Humans. They're so nosy," and then said louder, "Yes, we can take you somewhere. Um.. Where would you like to go?" "uhh" was all I said, then looked to Alex for help.
"I've always wondered where you go during the daytime." "Our home, of course." Then I see stars-literally!-and we're whizzing through galaxies and planets and stars, until I see a beautiful Planet. Frodo whooshes down through the air on <i>wings?</i> and so does Sam. I follow, and land in a tree.(Quite ungracefully). 
"So where is this?" Alex asks. "This Planet is called (dun-dun-dunnnnn: Eoturn; still thinking about it though). We live here. Sometimes, anyway."
